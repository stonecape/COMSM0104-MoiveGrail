# COMSM0104-MoiveGrail

Movie Grail is a simple movie recommendation website. Node js, Express web application framework, Bootstrap and etc. frameworks have been combined in this project. We also put effort into the following three aspects.

- #### Design
An amazing web design is our goal. We browsed a lot of well-designed web pages, which could give us more ideas. After numerous attempts to modify the style of all the elements, we produced a satisfactory result. Many techniques we have never learned are used during this progress, such as using css to implement some simple animations.
		
- #### Security
Although we did not implement HTTPS, preventing SQL injection, encrypted sensitive data and the attempt at using session and cookies to store login information are considered in this website.
	
- #### User Experience (Dynamic Pages)
In order to reduce the time of jumping to new web pages, most interactions between front-end and back-end are implemented by AJAX, which can provide a better user experience. Moreover, we paid more attention on tackling details, such as friendly tips and pop-ups.
